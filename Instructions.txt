Welcome to Rook: a trick-taking game made in 1906 by Hasbro.

1. 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are taken out of the deck (this iteration of the game does not have them present in the program at all.)

2. Rook Bird Card is added, totaling 41 cards.

3. Dealer shuffles, then deals cards one at a time to each player.
